DAY 1 :


Difference between http1.1 and http2.0


http 1.1 loads data one after the other if one data is not loaded it will block all the other data behind it 
Whereas http 2 sends multiple  data at once so that no one daya blocks any other data


http 1.1  keeps all requests and responses in plain text format
Whereas http 2 uses the binary framing layer to encapsulate all messages in binary format while still maintaining http semantics, such as verbs, methods, and headers.


In http 1.1 flow control relies on the underlying TCP connection 
Whereas http 2 multiplexes streams of data within a single TCP connection.
